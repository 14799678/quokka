Thanks to Coverity, those volunteers have been pointed to many quality and security issues via Coverity Scan, a service which finds defects in C/C++ and Java projects at no cost.</p> <p> As the CPython project includes over 370,000 lines of C code*, accounting for 42% of the codebase, a lot of it lies outside of the analysis tools our community has created to work with Python code. Since 2006, Coverity's scans of that code have found nearly 1,000 defects, 860 of which our contributors have fixed.</p> <p> In an industry where the standard defect density is a rate of 1 per 1,000 lines of code, CPython has attained a rate of 0.005 defects per 1,000 lines, and \"introduces a new level of quality for open source software,\" said Coverity.</p> <p> \"Python is the model citizen of good code quality practices, and we applaud their contributors and maintainers for their commitment to quality,\" said Jennifer Johnson, chief marketing officer for Coverity.</p> <p> The PSF and the rest of the community join Coverity in applauding all of those who have contributed their time and effort to make CPython a better project, along with the countless others who contribute to a powerful landscape of Python interpreters.</p>"

While Key Lime Pie was long expected to be the next major version of Android (4.4), <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/google-readies-android-kitkat-amid-1-billion-device-activations-milestone-7000020183/\">ZDNet's Rachel King reports</a> that it will now be known as KitKat.</p> <p>KitKat is a popular candy bar in the US and more importantly is well-known and iconic. Everyone recognizes the KitKat and Google is positioning Android to benefit from that recognition. While no money changed hands according to Google, a <a href=\"http://kitkat.com/#/acloserlook\">new promotional video from the KitKat </a>people (Nestle) makes it plain that Android is going to be quietly pushed in advertising for the candy.</p> <p>The clever video pushes the candy bar as a very high-tech product (KitKat 4.4) designed to meet customer's needs and desires. It's not a coincidence that the candy bar's version number, 4.4, also happens to be the Android version it represents. It is brilliantly done and seems to take a shot at Apple while quietly promoting Android. There is even an Android tablet shown in the production.</p> <!-- Parsed pinbox:\"10126430\" --> <div class=\"relatedContent alignRight\"> <h3>What's Hot on ZDNet</h3><ul> <li> <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/mac-mini-transition-week-two-mini-mizing-problems-7000020170/\"> Wanted: Real convergence, not more gear </a></li>  <li><a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/7-things-i-wish-ios-7-could-do-7000019784/\"> 7 things I wish iOS 7 could do</a></li>  <li><a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/lenovo-doubles-down-on-convertible-pc-bet-yoga-tizes-lineup-7000020187/\">Lenovo doubles down on convertible PC bet</a></li>  <li><a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/nokia-is-dead-newkia-rises-from-its-ashes-7000020271/\"> Nokia is dead, Newkia rises from its ashes</a></li> </ul></div> <p>This collaboration between Google and Nestle with the KitKat brand positions the former to put the Android brand front and center with mainstream consumers. That's not been done before as phone partner branding is usually the OEM brand only. There have been phone launch events recently that don't even mention Android, and Google must have been concerned about that.</p> <p>Don't be surprised to see more KitKat promotional materials that quietly push Android to the non-tech world. It's already started with both the video mentioned above and the special packages of KitKat bars that have Willy Wonka-style tickets inside to give Nexus 7 tablets to lucky recipients. It's clear Google is taking the Androidbrand mainstream with the KitKat affiliation.</p><p>As clever as this partnership with KitKat may be, somefolks are not happy that Key Lime Pie was dropped in favorof KitKat. Twitter folk were buzzing about the name switch,including Bridget Carey and Tim Stevens of CNET:</p><figure><img title=\"KitKat Twitter\" alt=\"KitKat Twitter\" src=\"http://cdn-static.zdnet.com/i/r/story/70/00/020234/kitkat-twitter-332x396.jpg?hash=MzMvMQRlMw&amp;upscale=1\"height=\"396\" width=\"332\"></figure>"
